# Day 8

1. Struct Structure

2. Property Observers

**didSet** is used to detect every time the property changes and print it to the screen.

You can also use **willSet** to take action before a property changes, but that is rarely used.

4. Mutating Method

Swift doesn't like to change variables much either. She usually tries to keep them steady. If you want to change something in the method, you have to declare it. The solution for this is quite simple.
