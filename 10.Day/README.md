5. Copying objects ***Important Point!***

Singer and singerCopy point to the same place in memory. Therefore, when the name of the copy was changed, the name of the original was also changed.

Another important point is that if **Struct** was used instead of **Class**, memory would not point to the same place and the name would not change.
