# Day 12

1. Handling Miss Data

It is the Null Safe event in Dart usage. For example, it is the probability that the data from the endPoint is null.

2. Unwrapping optionals

Checking for null with if let.

At the same time, this process is done with guard let. However, guard let only enters here if it is null.

By the way, the concept of null in Swift is called nil. It will take time to get used to it, I admit.

3. Force unwrapping

It means I promise it won't be nil no matter what. So that's what I understood from the descriptions. I will understand better when I start the project soon.

4. Implicity unwrapped optionals

Same logic

5. Nil Coalesing Operator

If this operator is nil, it means do this. But I don't know what the for: is taken as a parameter here. I do not understand.

6. Optional Chaining

In chaining logic it is really a nil check control.
