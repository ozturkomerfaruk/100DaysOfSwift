# Day 2

1. Array as Int, Double etc. You can store a variable. With Enumerated you can store it with indexes.

2. In Sets, events are just like Arrays. However, all characters must be unique.

3. Tuple is a little different. You cannot add or remove data from a tuple. They are fixed. You cannot change its type. It only allows you to access and read the index. Or it allows you to make a change of that type.

# Array vs Set vs Tuple

If you have constant data and you want to use it all the time you should use **Tuple**.

If you want to include non-repeating expressions in an array, you should use **Set**

If the order of the items added matters and you can add or remove things as you wish. you should use **Array**
