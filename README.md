# The Most Robust Swift Course
The title was very ambitious, but I can honestly say that it is an excellent resource you can learn from. I would like to share with you the most robust course I have come across while researching resources on Swift.

Here you get the opportunity to improve yourself with free document files, video content and homework for 100 days. There are two rules here.

1. You will spend at least 1 hour with Swift every day.
2. And you will share your process on social media to people.

I wanted to share this process with you here. For this, I created a Github Repo and shared the codes there day by day. I tried to write the descriptions of the codes with MackDown. So you can have a look.

To access Turkish explanations. This website is my blog page. You can follow me :)
